The Bin Packing Problem (BPP) is a combinatorial optimization problem where items of varying sizes must be packed into a minimum number of bins, each with a fixed capacity. The objective is to distribute items efficiently to reduce waste while ensuring that no bin exceeds its capacity.

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a heuristic optimization technique inspired by natural selection and evolution. It is particularly useful for solving NP-hard problems like bin packing, where an exact solution is computationally expensive.
